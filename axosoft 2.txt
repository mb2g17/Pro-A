TODO:
- add validation to automata operations
- validate no weird unicode characters in the input

- reorder tabs

- add validation to stop duplicate transitions (e.g. trying to do (a,A,B) twice)
- transitions should be made by pressing "enter", like with new automata

- change config table to allow stack trace
- make nodes light up in animation

- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus

- add controls to change the size of loop transitions

- make 'delete' delete all objects in your selection, not just the one you clicked on
- make 'alt-click' also select transitions

- add 'non-empty symbol' turing machine read symbol
- add 'write nothing' turing machine write symbol
- add 'do not move' turing machine direction
- make transition symbols into words, not just letters

- BUG: event handlers are still activated even when automata tab is closed
- BUG: holding alt, defocusing the browser and releasing alt still keeps Pro-A in "holding down alt" mode
- BUG: edge handles gets saved as their own objects when saving automata (also re-do saved automata)
- BUG: when moving an edge using the edge editing thing, your selected edges do not update, making state folds error


IN PROGRESS:
- make automata operations support PDA and TM
