TODO:
- make automata operations support PDA and TM
- add validation to automata operations

- reorder tabs

- make transition symbols into words, not just letters
- change "__epsilon" to ε
- change "__empty" input stack symbol to ⊥ (PDA)
- change null or "any symbol" for input stack symbol to ε (PDA)
- change "__empty" written tape symbol to □ (TM)
- add validation to stop duplicate transitions (e.g. trying to do (a,A,B) twice)
- transitions should be made by pressing "enter", like with new automata

- make "step"s start at initial state
- change config table to allow stack trace
- make nodes light up in animation

- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus

- BUG: toggling final state doesn't actually make it non-final in the simulation
- BUG: disable transitions to state folds



IN PROGRESS:
