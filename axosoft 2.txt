TODO:
- add validation to automata operations
- validate no weird unicode characters in the input (only letters and numbers allowed)

- reorder tabs

- add validation to stop duplicate transitions (e.g. trying to do (a,A,B) twice)
- transitions should be made by pressing "enter", like with new automata

- change config table to allow stack trace
- make nodes light up in animation
- colour code the configurations

- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus

- add controls to change the size of loop transitions

- add ability to add labels to state folds

- make 'delete' delete all objects in your selection, not just the one you clicked on
- make 'alt-click' also select transitions

- add "comments" to automata screen

- If two configurations are the same, it should only appear once

- BUG: event handlers are still activated even when automata tab is closed
- BUG: holding alt, defocusing the browser and releasing alt still keeps Pro-A in "holding down alt" mode
- BUG: edge handles gets saved as their own objects when saving automata (also re-do saved automata)
- BUG: when moving an edge using the edge editing thing, your selected edges do not update, making state folds error
- BUG: double check alt+clicking and duplication, as well as deleting state with transitions attached to it
- BUG: can rename state folds (might want to adapt this later for labelling state folds)


IN PROGRESS:
- add serialisation to alphabet cache
- add in concat for TMs

- make automata operations support TM
- add test cases for TM automata operations
