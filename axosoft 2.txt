TODO:
- make automata operations support PDA and TM
- add validation to automata operations

- reorder tabs

- make transition symbols into words, not just letters
- add validation to stop duplicate transitions (e.g. trying to do (a,A,B) twice)
- transitions should be made by pressing "enter", like with new automata

- make "step"s start at initial state
- change config table to allow stack trace
- make nodes light up in animation

- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus

- BUG: event handlers are still activated even when automata tab is closed
- BUG: holding alt, defocusing the browser and releasing alt still keeps Pro-A in "holding down alt" mode


IN PROGRESS:
