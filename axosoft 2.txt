--* TODO:

VALIDATION:
- validate no weird unicode characters in the input (only letters and numbers allowed)
- add validation to stop duplicate transitions (e.g. trying to do (a,A,B) twice)

CONFIG TABLE:
- change config table to allow stack trace
- colour code the configurations
- add a button to "delete" a configuration
- add a button to "prune" or "exclude" a configuration (delete all except that one)

ANIMATION:
- make nodes light up in animation

UI:
- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus
- transitions should be made by pressing "enter", like with new automata
- reorder tabs
- add ability to add labels to state folds

OTHER / UNCATEGORISED:
- add controls to change the size of loop transitions
- make 'delete' delete all objects in your selection, not just the one you clicked on
- add "comments" to automata screen
- If two configurations are the same, it should only appear once

- use a server to store automata tabs that aren't open

- BUG: event handlers are still activated even when automata tab is closed
- BUG: holding alt, defocusing the browser and releasing alt still keeps Pro-A in "holding down alt" mode
- BUG: edge handles gets saved as their own objects when saving automata (also re-do saved automata)
- BUG: when moving an edge using the edge editing thing, your selected edges do not update, making state folds error
- BUG: double check alt+clicking and duplication, as well as deleting state with transitions attached to it
- BUG: can rename state folds (might want to adapt this later for labelling state folds)
- BUG: on selecting a machine with one transition, edge editing messes up transition selection
- BUG: config table should use alias names, not true names
- BUG: you can't duplicate state folds


--* IN PROGRESS:
- Remove indexes from reference names
