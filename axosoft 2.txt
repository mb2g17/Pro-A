--* TODO:

VALIDATION:

CONFIG TABLE:
- change config table to allow stack trace
- colour code the configurations

ANIMATION:

UI:
- make filled buttons and outline buttons consistent in the menus
- reorder tabs
- add ability to add labels to state folds

OTHER / UNCATEGORISED:
- add controls to change the size of loop transitions
- add "comments" to automata screen
- If two configurations are the same, it should only appear once

- use a server to store automata tabs that aren't open

- BUG: holding alt, defocusing the browser and releasing alt still keeps Pro-A in "holding down alt" mode
- BUG: edge handles gets saved as their own objects when saving automata (also re-do saved automata)
- BUG?: double check alt+clicking and duplication, as well as deleting state with transitions attached to it
- BUG: can rename state folds (might want to adapt this later for labelling state folds)
- BUG: on selecting a machine with one transition, edge editing messes up transition selection
- BUG: with TMs, since some transitions are technically epsilon moves, there is a problem with duplicate transitions
- BUG: attempting to nest state folds crashes system (click on a state fold, then click "state fold")
- BUG: when the last node is removed from a state fold, the state fold persists as a blue node
